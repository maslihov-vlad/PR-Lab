# PR-Lab
# Lab 1:Restaurant Simulation

>The main goal of this lab work is to develope two servers: Dining hall and Kitchen that would be able to communicate with each other. I used C++ as selected language and a beautifull libarary "Boost" to have possibility to write an easier server communcation using asynch methods which Boost provides you. I choosed "cmake" because of choosed language and for me it looks better because of its architecture style.

### Required features:

- 2 Servers: Dining Hall and Kitchen as multithread asynch servers
- Multithreading


### Used Technologies:

- Windows 10 
- WSL Ubuntu
- C++
- Cmake
- Boost C++ library

(Recommend to run it on WSL or real Linux system)
To run the application you have to create "build" folder in root directory of this lab and compile it through "cmake" command.
